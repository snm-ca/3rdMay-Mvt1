A Song of the Century
Third of May Suite - Three-Part Sonata and Fantasia - First Movement

This is a work not tied to any community - British or Irish - but for all those
across historical lands of the Ulaid in modern Ireland and Britain, regardless
of politics or affiliation. It is neither a celebration nor a protest.

Backgrounds of the both the largest communities in the region
contributed to authorship. As such, it should never be referred to as British, Irish,
from Britain, UK or Ireland, or in terms of unionism, nationalism and, in no circumstances,
religious terms, such as Catholic or Protestant, neither one nor both.
